TL;DR
This blog is a summary and retrospect of my recent works on cache eviction. 
I will first introduce the problem of cache eviction, then I will introduce two cache eviction algorithms, [S3-FIFO](https://s3fifo.com) and [SIEVE](https://sievecache.com), and finally, I will discuss future work. 

## What is a cache and cache eviction algorithm? 
A cache is a _fast_ but _small_ storage that stores frequently accessed data. If the requested data is in the cache, it can be served much faster than retrieving from the backend storage or database. However, a cache is small and cannot store all the data. 
A cache eviction algorithm decides which object should be evicted when the cache is full and is a core component of a cache. 

## Common cache eviction algorithms 
### FIFO (First-in-first-out)


### LRU (Least-recently-used)


### LFU (Least-frequently-used) 


### CLOCK 



## More advanced eviction algorithms 
### ARC 


### LIRS


### TinyLFU 


### 2Q 



This section only introduce algorithms that are or were used in real systems. However, there are many other algorithms that are proposed in the past two decades. And some of them introduce very neat or interesting ideas, such as [LHD](https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi18/presentation/beckmann), [LRB](https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi20/presentation/song), [LeCaR](https://www.usenix.org/conference/hotstorage18/presentation/vietri). I have implemented these algorithms in [libCacheSim](https://libcachesim.com) and compared them with other algorithms. However, they do not show advantages compared to the ones introduced above, so I will not introduce them here. 

## New research: simple, scalable, yet effective eviction algorithms 
### Two techniques 


### S3-FIFO 




### SIEVE 


## Comparing the algorithms 

Twitter cluster52 sample 10 traces 1343968423 requests

wiki2019t sample 10 21029271 requests

metaCDN reag 45623306 requests 

metaKV 1644762386 requests

zipf 1m object 20m requests



Adoption Status 
Although S3-FIFO achieves low miss ratios than state-of-the-art algorithms across over 6000 traces over all, S3-FIFO is not the best algorithm on every trace. 

 and SIEVE are the best on every possible workload, 




## Conclusion 
This blog is a summary and retrospect of my recent works on cache eviction.
