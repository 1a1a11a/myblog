TL;DR
This blog is a summary and retrospect of my recent works on cache eviction. 
I will first introduce the problem of cache eviction, then I will introduce two cache eviction algorithms, S3-FIFO and SIEVE, and finally I will discuss the future work.



What is a cache

What is cache eviction
Different types of cache eviction algorithms
New Research from CMU: Simple, yet effective eviction algorithms
Where fancy techniques fail
Adaptive algorithms are not free of parameters
Adaptive algorithms can fail mysteriously
Lack of history render fancy techniques helpless


Adoption Status 
Although S3-FIFO achieves low miss ratios than state-of-the-art algorithms across over 6000 traces over all, S3-FIFO is not the best algorithm on every trace. 

 and SIEVE are the best on every possible workload,
