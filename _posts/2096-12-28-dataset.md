Caching is a widely used technique to improve the performance of many systems. A cache is a small, fast memory that stores a subset of data from a larger, slower storage system. 
Caches are used in a variety of systems, from the browser caches in personal devices, CDN caches on the edge, to various  including CPUs, web servers, and distributed storage systems.
